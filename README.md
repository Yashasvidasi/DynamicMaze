# Grid Game

## Overview

Grid Game is a captivating game where users can place characters and ghosts on a grid. The game features pathfinding algorithms, such as A*, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS), which attempt to find solutions based on the positions of the characters and ghosts.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **Frontend:** Vite React
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** A*, BFS, DFS

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grid-game.git
   cd grid-game
   ```

2. **Set up the backend:**

   Navigate to the `src` directory and install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   cd src
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend:**

   Navigate back to the root directory and install the frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Project
